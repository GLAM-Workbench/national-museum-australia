    "# Harvest records from the NMA API\n",
    "\n",
    "The National Museum of Australia provides access to its [collection data through an API](https://www.nma.gov.au/about/our-collection/our-apis). But if you're going to do any large-scale analysis of the data, you probably want to harvest and save it locally. This notebook helps you do just that.\n",
    "\n",
    "According to the [API documentation](https://github.com/NationalMuseumAustralia/Collection-API/wiki/Getting-started), the possible endpoints are:\n",
    "\n",
    "* `/object` - the museum catalogue plus images/media\n",
    "* `/narrative` - narratives by Museum staff about featured topics\n",
    "* `/party` - people and organisations associated with collection items\n",
    "* `/place` - locations associated with collection items\n",
    "* `/collection` - sub-collections within the museum catalogue\n",
    "* `/media` - images and other media associated with collection items\n",
    "\n",
    "This notebook should harvest records from any of these endpoints, though I've only tested `object`, `party`, and `place`.\n",
    "\n",
    "It harvests records in the [simple JSON format](https://github.com/NationalMuseumAustralia/Collection-API/wiki/Getting-started#simple-json) and saves them as they are to a file-based database using [TinyDB](https://tinydb.readthedocs.io/en/latest/). See the other notebooks in this repository for examples of loading the JSON data into a DataFrame for manipulation and analysis."
